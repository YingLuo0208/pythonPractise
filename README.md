## 4.5
Write a program that asks the user for a username and password.
If either or both are incorrect, the program ask the user to enter the username and password again.
This continues until the login information is correct or wrong credentials have been entered five times.
If the information is correct, the program prints out Welcome.
After five failed attempts the program prints out Access denied.
The correct username is python and password rules.

```python
T_username = "python"
T_password = "rules"
time = 0
while time < 5:
    time += 1
    username = input("Enter your name: ")
    password = input("Enter your password: ")
    if username == T_username and password == T_password :
        print("Welcome!")
        break
    elif ( username != T_username or password != T_password )and time != 5:

## 4.6
Implement an algorithm for calculating an approximation for the value of pi (Ï).
Let's assume that A is a unit circle. A unit circle has the radius of one and it is centered at the origin (0,0). Smallest possible square B is drawn around the unit circle
so that circle A is completely inside the square.
The corners of the square are now (-1,-1), (1, -1), (1, 1), and (-1, 1).
If a large number of random points are scattered inside the square,the fraction of points that fall inside the circle A correlates with the fraction of the area of circle A compared to the area of square B: Ïr^2/4 = Ï*1^2/4 = Ï/4.
This can be used as a simple method for calculating an approximation of the value of pi:
Let's generate a large number of random points, such as one million, inside square B.
Let N be the total number of random points.
Each point inside the square is tested for whether it resides inside circle A.
Let n be the total number of points that fall inside circle A.
Now we have n/NâÏ/4, and from that we get Ïâ4n/N.
Write a program that asks the user how many random points to generate,and then calculates the approximate value of pi using the method explained above.
At the end, the program prints out the approximation of pi to the user.
(Notice that it is easy to test if a point falls inside circle A by testing
if it fulfills the inequation x^2+y^2<1.).

```python
import random

point_all = 0
point_circle = 0
point_user = int(input("How many points do you want? "))

while point_all < point_user:
    point_all = point_all + 1
    x = random.uniform(-1, 1)
    y = random.uniform(-1, 1)
    if x ** 2 + y ** 2 <= 1:
        point_circle = point_circle + 1

pi = 4 * point_circle / point_user
print(f"The approximation of pi is {pi:.10f}")
```
```monospace
How many points do you want? 1000000
The approximation of pi is 3.1406440000
```
    
# 5. List structures and iterative loops (for)
## 5.1
Write a program that asks the user how many dice to roll.
The program rolls all the dice once and prints out the sum of the numbers. Use a for loop.

```python
import random

times = int(input("How many times would you like to roll? : "))
sum_of_numbers = 0
numbers =[]
for i in range(times):
    roll = random.randint(1, 6)
    numbers.append(roll)
    sum_of_numbers = sum_of_numbers + roll
print(numbers)
print(sum_of_numbers)

```
```monospace
How many times would you like to roll? : 6
[3, 5, 4, 3, 1, 2]

```

## 5.2
Write a program that asks the user to enter numbers until they input an empty string to quit.
At the end, the program prints out the five greatest numbers sorted in descending order.
Hint: You can reverse the order of sorted list items by using the sort method
with the reverse=True argument.

```python
numbers = []

while True:
    user_number = input("Enter a number: ")
    if user_number == "":
        break
    numbers.append(int(user_number))

numbers.sort(reverse=True)
first_five_numbers = numbers[:5]

print(first_five_numbers)
```
```monospace
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 40
Enter a number: 56
Enter a number: 39
Enter a number: 28
Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 888
Enter a number: 
[888, 56, 40, 39, 28]
```

## 5.3
Write a program that asks the user for an integer and tells if the number is a prime number.
Prime numbers are number that are only divisible by one or the number itself.
For example, 13 is a prime number as it can only be divided by 1 or 13 so that the result is an integer.
On the other hand, 21 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3 and 7.

```python
user_num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
divided_by = []

if user_num <= 1 or user_num == 4:
    print("Your number is not a prime number.")

elif user_num in { 2,3,5 }:
    print("Your number is a prime number.")

elif user_num > 5:
    for i in range(2,user_num,1):
        if user_num % i == 0 :
            divided_by.append(i)
            break

    if len(divided_by) == 0 :
        print("Your number is a prime number.")
    else:
        print("Your number is not a prime number.")
```
```monospace
Enter a number: 0
Your number is not a prime number.

Enter a number: 1
Your number is not a prime number.

Enter a number: 2
Your number is a prime number.

Enter a number: 4
Your number is not a prime number.

Enter a number: 21
Your number is not a prime number.
```

## 5.4
Write a program that asks the user to enter the names of five cities one by on (use a for loop for reading the names) and stores them into a list structure.
Finally, the program prints out the names of the cities one by one, one city per line,in the same order they were read as input.
Use a for loop for asking the names and a for/in loop to iterate through the list.

```python
cities = []

for a in range(5):
    city = input("Enter a city: ")
    cities.append(city)

for city in cities:
    print(city)
```
```monospace

```

# 6. Functions
## 6.1
Write a function that returns a random dice roll between 1 and 6.The function should not have any parameters.
Write a main program that rolls the dice until the result is 6.The main program should print out the result of each roll.

```python
import random

def roll():
    dice = random.randint(1,6)
    return dice
                           # result = roll()  # Start by rolling the dice
while True:                # while result != 6:
    result = roll()        #     print(result)  # Print the current roll
    if result == 6 :       #     result = roll()  # Roll the dice again
        print(result)      # print(result)  # Print the final result when it's 6
        break
    print(result)
```
```monospace

```

## 6.2
Modify the function above so that it gets the number of sides on the dice as a parameter.
With the modified function you can for example roll a 21-sided role-playing dice.
The difference to the last exercise is that the dice rolling in the main program continues until the program gets the maximum number on the dice,which is asked from the user at the beginning.

```python
import random

def roll(sides):
    dice = random.randint(1, sides)
    return dice

dice_max = int(input("Enter a number: "))

while True:
    result = roll(dice_max)

    if result == dice_max :
        print(result)
        print("You rolled the maximum number! ")
        break
    print(result)
```

Enter number of gasoline in American gallons : -1
Error input.
```

## 6.4
Write a function that gets a list of integers as a parameter.The function returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.
For testing, write a main program where you create a list,call the function, and print out the value it returned.

```python
def f(list_int):
    all_numbers = 0
    for i in list_int:
        all_numbers = all_numbers + i
    return all_numbers

numbers = [2,4,6,10]

sum_numbers = f(numbers)
print(f"The sum of {numbers} is {sum_numbers}")
```
```monospace

```

## 6.5
Write a function that gets a list of integers as a parameter.
The function returns a second list that is otherwise the same as the original list except that all uneven numbers have been removed.
For testing, write a main program where you create a list, call the function,and then print out both the original as well as the cut-down list.

```python
def n(list_int):
    for i in list_int[:]:
        if i % 2 != 0:

```

## 6.6
Write a function that receives two parameters:the diameter of a round pizza in centimeters and the price of the pizza in euros.
The function calculates and returns the unit price of the pizza per square meter.
The main program asks the user to enter the diameter and price of two pizzas and tells the user which pizza provides better value for money(which of them has a lower unit price).
You must use the function you wrote for calculating the unit prices.

```python
import math

def calculate_unit_price(diameter,price):
    # Calculate the area of the pizza (in square meters) Diameter is in cm, convert to meters
    pizza_size = (diameter /100 / 2) ** 2 * math.pi
    # Calculate the price per square meter
    unit_price = price / pizza_size
    return unit_price

# Get user input for the first pizza
diameter1 = float(input("Enter your first diameter(cm): "))
price1 = float(input("Enter your first price: "))

# Calculate unit price for the first pizza
unit_price1 = calculate_unit_price(diameter1,price1)

# Get user input for the second pizza
diameter2 = float(input("Enter your second diameter(cm): "))
price2 = float(input("Enter your second price: "))

# Calculate unit price for the second pizza
unit_price2 = calculate_unit_price(diameter2,price2)

# Compare unit prices and print results
if unit_price1 < unit_price2:
    print(f"The first pizza is {unit_price1:.2f} euros/square meter.")
    print(f"The second pizza is {unit_price2:.2f} euros/square meter.")
    print("The first pizza has a lower unit price.")
elif unit_price2 < unit_price1:
    print(f"The first pizza is {unit_price1:.2f} euros/square meter.")
    print(f"The second pizza is {unit_price2:.2f} euros/square meter.")
    print("The second pizza has a lower unit price.")
else:
    print(f"The first pizza is {unit_price1:.2f} euros/square meter.")
    print(f"The second pizza is {unit_price2:.2f} euros/square meter.")
    print("They have the same unit price.")
```
```monospace
Enter your first diameter(cm): 2
Enter your first price: 3.3
Enter your second diameter(cm): 3
Enter your second price: 4.4
The first pizza is 10504.23 euros/square meter.
The second pizza is 6224.73 euros/square meter.
The second pizza has a lower unit price.
```

# 7. Tuple, set, and dictionary
## 7.1
Write a program that asks the user for a number of a month and then prints out the corresponding season (spring, summer, autumn, winter).
Save the seasons as strings into a tuple in your program.
We can define each season to last three months,December being the first month of winter.
```python
season = ("","winter","winter","spring","spring","spring","summer",
          "summer","summer","autumn","autumn","autumn","winter")

month_input = int(input("Enter a number of a month(1-12):"))
if 12 >= month_input >= 1:

Write a program that asks the user to enter names until he/she enters an empty string.
After each name is read the program either prints out New name or Existing name depending on whether the name was entered for the first time.
Finally, the program lists out the input names one by one,one below another in any order. Use the set data structure to store the names.

```python
names = set()
while True:
    name_new = input('Please enter a name (or press Enter to finish): ')
    if name_new == "":
        break
    if name_new in names:
        print("It was entered.")
    else:
        names.add(name_new)
        print("It's a new name.")
for a in names:
    print(a)
```
```monospace
Please enter a name (or press Enter to finish): 123
It's a new name.
Please enter a name (or press Enter to finish): aaa
It's a new name.
Please enter a name (or press Enter to finish): aaa
It was entered.
Please enter a name (or press Enter to finish): ccc
It's a new name.
Please enter a name (or press Enter to finish):

```

## 7.3
Write a program for fetching and storing airport data.
The program asks the user if they want to enter a new airport,fetch the information of an existing airport or quit.
If the user chooses to enter a new airport,the program asks the user to enter the ICAO code and name of the airport.
If the user chooses to fetch airport information instead,the program asks for the ICAO code of the airport and prints out the corresponding name. If the user chooses to quit,the program execution ends.
The user can choose a new option as many times they want until they choose to quit.
(The ICAO code is an identifier that is unique to each airport.For example, the ICAO code of Helsinki-Vantaa Airport is EFHK.You can easily find the ICAO codes of different airports online.)

```python
chooses = {'EFHK': 'Helsinki-Vantaa Airport',
           'ZBAA': 'Beijing Capital International Airport',
           'VHHH': 'Hong Kong International Airport',

Add a class initializer that sets the first two of the properties based on parameter values. The current speed and travelled distance of a new car must be automatically set to zero. Write a main program where you create a new car (registration number ABC-123, maximum speed 142 km/h). Finally, print out all the properties of the new car.
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, number, max_speed,speed = 0,distance = 0):
        self.number = number
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.speed = speed
        self.distance = distance

    def car_info(self):
        print(f"Registration number : {self.number}")
        print(f"Maximum speed : {self.max_speed}(km/h)")
        print(f"Current speed : {self.speed}(km/h)")
        print(f"Travelled distance : {self.distance}(km)")

new_car = Car("ABC-123",142)
new_car.car_info()
```
```monospace
Registration number : ABC-123
Maximum speed : 142(km/h)
Current speed : 0(km/h)
Travelled distance : 0(km)
```
## 9.2
Extend the program by adding an accelerate method into the new class. The method should receive the change of speed (km/h) as a parameter. If the change is negative, the car reduces speed. The method must change the value of the speed property of the object. The speed of the car must stay below the set maximum and cannot be less than zero. Extend the main program so that the speed of the car is first increased by +30 km/h, then +70 km/h and finally +50 km/h. Then print out the current speed of the car. Finally, use the emergency brake by forcing a -200 km/h change on the speed and then print out the final speed. The travelled distance does not have to be updated yet.
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, number, max_speed,speed = 0,distance = 0):
        self.number = number
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.speed = speed
        self.distance = distance

    def accelerate(self, speed_change):
        self.speed += speed_change
        if self.speed > self.max_speed:
            self.speed = self.max_speed
        elif self.speed < 0:
            self.speed = 0

    def car_info(self):
        print(f"Registration number : {self.number}")
        print(f"Maximum speed : {self.max_speed}(km/h)")
        print(f"Current speed : {self.speed}(km/h)")
        print(f"Travelled distance : {self.distance}(km)")

new_car = Car("ABC-123",142)
new_car.car_info()

new_car.accelerate(30)
new_car.car_info()

new_car.accelerate(70)
new_car.car_info()

new_car.accelerate(50)
new_car.car_info()

new_car.accelerate(-200)
new_car.car_info()
```
```monospace
Registration number : ABC-123
Maximum speed : 142(km/h)
Current speed : 0(km/h)
Travelled distance : 0(km)

Registration number : ABC-123
Maximum speed : 142(km/h)
Current speed : 30(km/h)
Travelled distance : 0(km)

Registration number : ABC-123
Maximum speed : 142(km/h)
Current speed : 100(km/h)
Travelled distance : 0(km)

Registration number : ABC-123
Maximum speed : 142(km/h)
Current speed : 142(km/h)
Travelled distance : 0(km)

Registration number : ABC-123
Maximum speed : 142(km/h)
Current speed : 0(km/h)
Travelled distance : 0(km)
```
## 9.3
Again, extend the program by adding a new drive method that receives the number of hours as a parameter. The method increases the travelled distance by how much the car has travelled in constant speed in the given time. Example: The travelled distance of car object is 2000 km. The current speed is 60 km/h. Method call car.drive(1.5) increases the travelled distance to 2090 km.
```python

```
```monospace

```
## 9.4
Now we will program a car race. The travelled distance of a new car is initialized as zero. At the beginning of the main program, create a list that consists of 10 car objects created using a loop. The maximum speed of each new car is a random value between 100 km/h and 200 km/h. The registration numbers are created as follows: "ABC-1", "ABC-2" and so on. Now the race begins. One per every hour of the race, the following operations are performed:

  The speed of each car is changed so that the change in speed is a random value between -10 km/h and +15 km/h. This is done using the accerelate method.
  Each car is made to drive for one hour. This is done with the drive method.
  
The race continues until one of the cars has advanced at least 10,000 kilometers. Finally, the properties of each car are printed out formatted into a clear table.
